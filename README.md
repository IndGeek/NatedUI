## ðŸ’¡ What is Nated UI?

Nated UI is a open source CSS Framework like Tailwind CSS and provides much more flexibity over tailwind in following ways:

- Lightweight
- Works just with a stylesheet link
- Dynamic class based styling (e.g. py-7 = padding: 7px 0;)
- UI Elements (working...)

## Where to use it from

Head over to ui.nated.in to access the Nated UI or use the stylesheet and scripts from here:

### For static styling:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://ui.nated.in/styles/min.css">
```
### For dynamic classes:
```html
<script src="https://ui.nated.in/styles/min.js"></script>
```

## ðŸ™Œ How to contribute

I'm trying to make time for the project to switch the website codebase to NextJS and the most important task, use Completely NatedUI on this website itself.

Creating the Documentation is a time consuming process. I believe the code is relatively easy to understand and also I've a video on that
